            <p>Why do i love <i>technology?</i><br>
            In simple words, technology is the superpower 
            that is creating constant evolution in education, bussiness, 
            communication, exchange systems e.t.c and
            holds massive potential for ground breaking solutions,

            <p>So far, I have become conversant with the foundations of
                 open source Software engineering collaboration using
                  <b><i>github</i></b> and the building blocks of creating a webpage 
                   using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS.</b>

            <p>The box model is an important core concept of cascading style sheets
                 because every HTML element is basically a box made up of content, padding,
                 border and margin.
                 Below are the differences between <strong>padding, margin and border</strong></p>
            <p><b><i>Padding:</i></b> This is the part of the box that is between the content and the border</p>
            <p><b><i>Margin:</i></b> This is the immediate entire space around the box.</p>
            <p><b><i>Border:</i></b> This is the edge of the box, the part of the box that is
                 between the padding and margin.</p>
